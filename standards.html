            <p>As soon as the tools are all packed away, and we’ve finished transforming your home, we’ll get your official guarantee dated and sent over to you! We want you to feel totally relaxed about your new investment, which is why our guarantee covers you for a full 20 years. Why so long? Simply because we’re confident in the quality of what we build. We use materials that are made to go the distance, so you don't have to worry about a thing.</p>
            <p style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 3px solid var(--brand-yellow);">To make sure you get the most out of your 20-year guarantee, it’s worth noting a couple of exceptions. Generally, things like accidents or extreme weather damage aren't covered. It’s also really important that we’re the only ones who work on the installation—having someone else (or yourself) modify or repair it would mean we can no longer guarantee the work. All the details are tucked away in your project paperwork if you need them!</p>
